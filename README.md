### For the Future
- [ ] Filter table results with search box
- [ ] Sortable columns
- [ ] Implement CSS modules (CSS on a global namespace is *so* 2015)
- [x] Persist data (currently using `localStorage`)
- [ ] Test coverage (Airbnb's `enzyme` seems like a good candidate)
- [ ] Increase responsiveness (tables are pretty meh for mobile)
- [ ] Enhance accessibility (`div`s inside `div`s inside `div`s isn't very semantic)
- [ ] Progressive enhancement (for offline or flaky network use)
